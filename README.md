- Task 1 - Pacman - Search Problems.

## Task 1 - Pacman
Demonstrating how to solve problems by searching as part of Artificial Intelligence course at Bar Ilan University.<br/>
The main goal of this exercise is to define and implement searching problems, solve them using uninformed search and heuristic search.

There is a list of commands(commands.txt) initiating different mazes with different goals using a number of algorithms:
1. Implemented DFS(Graph Search) using Stack.
2. Implemented BFS(Graph Search) using Queue.
3. Implemented Uniform Cost Search using Priority Queue.
4. Implemented A* Search using Priority Queue.

Defined Corners-Problem search problem: State, Goal and Successors.

Implemented Heuristic function(admissible and consistent) for Corners-Problem and Food Search-Problem.<br/>
Function calculates Manhattan distances from current position to closest goal in each state.
